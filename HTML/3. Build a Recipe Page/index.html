        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Cook the pasta:</b>
                    <br>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
                        Add spaghetti and cook according to package directions until al dente. 
                        Drain and set aside, reserving ½ cup of pasta water.
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <b>Make the sauce base:</b>
                    <br>In a large pan, melt the butter over medium heat. 
                        Add minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant (don't let it burn).
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Add the cream:</b>
                    <br>Pour in the heavy cream and stir gently. Let it simmer for 2-3 minutes until slightly thickened.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Add cheese and seasoning:</b>
                    <br>Stir in the Parmesan cheese until melted and smooth. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.

                <li>
                    <b>Combine with pasta:</b>
                    <br>Add the cooked spaghetti to the sauce. Toss well to coat evenly. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Serve:</b>
