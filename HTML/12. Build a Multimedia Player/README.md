Instructions:

Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.

In the prior lessons, you were introduced to working with audio and video elements. In this lab, you will build out a multimedia player that will display an audio track and video with a transcript.

For the audio element, you will need to include a source element which is used to specify the media being used.

Here is an example:
```html
<audio controls aria-label="descriptive label goes here">
  <source src="url-to-audio-goes-here" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
```

The source element can also be used in the video element like this:
```html
<video controls width="600" aria-label="descriptive label goes here">
  <source src="link-to-mp4-goes-here" type="video/mp4">
  <!-- Remaining code goes here -->  
</video>
```
