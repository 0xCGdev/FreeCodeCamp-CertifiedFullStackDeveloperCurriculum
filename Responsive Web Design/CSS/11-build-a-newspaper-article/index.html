        <p class="text">
            Frontend development has evolved rapidly over the past decade, transforming
            from simple static pages into highly interactive digital experiences. With
            the rise of modern frameworks, responsive design, and performance-focused
            tooling, developers are now expected to balance aesthetics, accessibility,
            and efficiency.

        <p class="text">
            As technology continues to advance, the role of a frontend developer becomes
            more strategic. Understanding user behavior, optimizing performance, and
            creating scalable design systems are no longer optional skills but essential
            foundations for building meaningful products in the modern web ecosystem.
